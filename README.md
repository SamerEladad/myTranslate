# MyTranslate

## Overview
MyTranslate is a web application designed for the translation of scientific texts, aimed at supporting students and teachers. Developed as part of the Information and Communication Systems course at Hochschule Bochum, this project bridges the gap in translating complex academic materials.

## Key Features
- **Student Order Management**: Students can view and filter their translation orders based on status.
- **Teacher Order Fulfillment**: Teachers can view and filter all open and fulfilled orders, particularly in languages they are proficient in.
- **Point-Based Reward System**: Teachers earn more points for longer texts, incentivizing the completion of more challenging orders.
- **User-Friendly Design**: A focus on front-end design and user experience, achieved through JavaScript and a modern theme.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, Bootstrap, Smarty for dynamic and responsive design.
- **Backend**: SQL and PHP for robust data handling and server-side logic.
- **Database**: SQL and phpMyAdmin used for database management.

## Getting Started
The development of MyTranslate was coordinated using a Kanban framework, which facilitated task delegation, regular communication, and monitoring of progress and deadlines.

## Contribution
This project was a collaborative effort among three colleagues, with my role encompassing project management. While I contributed significantly across all project aspects, the team's collective effort was vital.

## Acknowledgements
